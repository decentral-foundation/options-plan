# Remote Social Media + PR Support (Less than full time)

$60k – $80k

## Your responsibilities will include:

Create five short form videos for FK per week (and post) think reels/tiktoks  
Manage engagement + DM's (daily)  

## PR Support

How to apply: Using the free app loom, please send in a video of you teaching me something (anything) in 30 seconds or less. We are looking for someone with good-vibes and performs well on camera. Please attach a (look) link or a direct link to tiktok/youtube/IG!  
When you go to submit your video - we need to see your ability to teach us something.  
Think something like this: instagram.com/p/CnkJJUzqeRe or if you don't want to show your face try one of these formats instagram.com/p/CnfjzdHIjxZ   
This can be about anything you want! (These are just silly examples! We'd like to see your ability to teach on camera.)   
Feel free to send in a resume - that said, we care more about the video and your cover letter!  

## Social Media - the process will look something like this:    

1.) Heidi will provide themes/topics for video ideas on Monday via a meeting  
2.) You will record videos on your phone (using a video editing app) and then use loom to send us a screen recording for feedback by Wednesday end of day.  
3.) On Thursday AM we’ll provide feedback. If everything looks good you’ll add closed captions, captions, and words on the cover.  
4.) You’ll be in charge of posting videos the week after. (While restarting from step #1)  

## PR:

Find, apply for/contact, follow up, and track PR opportunities for Heidi and Ling. You’ll be expected to contact 5 per week.    
Note: Heidi will supply a list of PR opportunities she wants to tackle, but you will be in charge of doing some research on your own. Additionally, Heidi will provide easy to use spreadsheets to track opportunities/follow ups and well as the exact copy needed to reach out/apply in the first place.  
Notes:  
You’ll be required to come to two meetings per week (a KPI identification meeting and the social media/blog themes meeting)  
We are seeking funding right now - meaning, once we get funding we'll pay you what we owe you. We expect this to be within a few months, but we cannot be sure!  
We are happy for you to have other jobs while we seek funding and are happy to work around your hours.  
We work during US time zones
