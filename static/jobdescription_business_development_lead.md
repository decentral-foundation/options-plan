Decentral is building the future of sole-ownership and decentralization of data.
We are a team of high-performance individuals. Artists. The starting lineup. Always hunting for the next best product, strategy, and execution. Whether you’re with us in our offices in Santa Clara and San Francisco, or even remotely, a job at Decentral will be demanding. Yet we reward those that deliver results. Those that can think bottom up, from a first principles standpoint. And we wouldn’t ask for anything else.
At Decentral, we don’t just build software. We innovate where we are recognized at the top of adjacent industries. Join the team that manifests the standards of excellence, and does whatever it takes to realize that value. We want your unique experience and strengths to guide us to a better tomorrow.
Does a resourceful, dynamic and withstanding environment activate your reticular activation system? Do you like to venture into that part of the world where you can’t “Google your answers” to solve your problems anymore? It happens when your abilities cross the threshold from exceptional to elite. If you know what that feels like, you’ll be a great fit for our team!
